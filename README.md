In this project, I hoped to create a chatbot with a simnmnple, sleek frontned mechanism, a strong backend with domain knowledge and ability to answer a variety of questions, ability to take feedback and learn from it, as well as general memory and context awareness.
These were achieved using LangChain's various mechanisms. They are as follows:

### Context remembrance and Conversation Memory: ConversationalSummaryBufferMemory from Langchain
### Built in context, basic memory and system prompt : MongoDB Atlas and PyMongo
### Front end Chat Interface : Streamlit Chat Messages
### Chatbot : OpenAI (HuggingFace Hub models also encouraged for open source alternatives)
### Feedback collection, and analysis : Trubrics
### Feedback learning : MongoDB Atlas (we import memory from it and hence we add question answer pairs with positive feedback to our DB as extra few-shot prompting examples)

I'd like to keep it short and hence, in conclusion, I'd like to thank you all for viewing this repository and I hope you all have a wonderful day!!!
